        <p>
          FamilySearch website gives the following- Pritchard name
          meaning-“Welsh: Anglicized form of Welsh ap Rhisiart&apos;son of
          Richard&apos;(see Richard ).”

          When Henry A Pritchard was born on June 23, 1848, in Llanelly,
          Breconshire, Wales, his father, George, was 34 and his mother,
          Elizabeth (Jenkins), was 21. George and Elizabeth were married March
          13, 1847 in the Llanelly Parish Church. On July 24,1834, at the age of
          20, George was convicted of being rogue and a vagabond and sentenced
          to 3 calendar months of hard labor. In 1842, at the recorded age of
          28, George was convicted of assault and sentenced to 12 months
          imprisonment. George worked as a puddler. Henry had 6 brothers;
          William (1851-1929), Thomas (1853-1885), John James (1854-1934),
          Charles (1856-1928), Lewis (1858-1921), and James (1861-1912). For
          many years, he was employed as a puddler. He worked at Bethlehem Steel
          Company until he was 76. 1930 United States Census list Henry living
          with Arthur and Emma Snyder at 310 Grand Street, Danville, PA. He died
          on April 12 (daughter Kim&apos;s Birthday), 1932, in Danville,
          Pennsylvania, at the age of 80 at the home of his daughter, Mrs.
          Arthur K. Snyder. Cause of death was Acute Cardiac Dilatation with
          contributory Myocarditis and other. Gene Snyder told me that when
          Henry died he was embalmed in the bathroom and placed in a room in the
          house. A family member sat with his body. Gene said he was too young
          (born in 1925), but his brothers (Born1910 & 1916) took their turn
          sitting with Henry&apos;s body and Gene would poke his head in the
          room.

          William was born in Llanelly, Breconshire, Wales. The 1871 Wales
          Census shows William’s occupation as a puddler. He married Sarah Ann
          in 1874. Their daughter Sarah Jane was born on March 23, 1878, in Ebbw
          Vale, Monmouthshire, Wales. In the 1881 Census, John (Driller Iron),
          Lewis (Driller), and James (Baller) are listed as boarders in
          William’s household. I found in the Wales Census that living as a
          boarder or lodger, usually in a family members household to be common.
          William’s occupation is “Baller Iron”. I found this on the internet-“A
          baller was a puddler who worked at a ball furnace in which iron or
          steel scrap or bars of puddled iron were treated to form an even purer
          wrought iron than is made from cast iron.” 1891 Census shows William
          living with brother, James. 1901 Census shows William as the head of
          the household at 50, Sarah Ann, wife, age 47 and a daughter, Sarah
          Jane at age 23. On June 18, 1906, his daughter, Sarah Jane (Age 28),
          married a Cephas Gregg Mills (Age 28) in the Llanelly Parish Church.
          William worked as a furnace man at this time. Sarah Jane’s daughter
          Phyllis Pritchard Mills was born in October 1906 in Bedwellty,
          Monmouthshire, Wales. Record show William buried on the 12th of
          February, 1929 in the Parish of Llanelly in the county of Brecon. He
          was 78 years old. William and Sarah Ann were married 55 years at the
          time of his death. Following is a picture from Gene Snyder Jr. taken
          from his father’s photos. It possibly is William Pritchard, Henry’s
          oldest brother.

          Thomas was born about 1853 in Llanelly, Breconshire, Wales. 1881 Wales
          Census list him as a boarder in the home of Benjamin Griffiths.
          Benjamin’s wife’s (Jane) maiden name was Jenkins. She was Elizabeth
          Jenkins’ sister, who was George Pritchard’s wife. This makes Jane,
          Thomas’ aunt. His occupation is Iron Puddler. He died in 1885 at the
          age of 32, and was buried in Rhymney, Monmouthshire, Wales on May 27.

          1871 Wales Census list Charles occupation as puddler. He was 15 years
          old. Charles married Catherine Morgan (B. 1859) in 1878. Their
          children were Elizabeth Maud (1879–1908) and Gathorne Morgan
          (1889-1893). His son Gathorne Morgan passed away in 1893 at the age of
          4. Daughter Elizabeth Maud passed away on December 15, 1908, at the
          age of 29. 1881 Wales Census list Charles and family as lodgers in the
          Thomas Jones household. Occupation is Puddler Iron. 1891 Census lists
          his occupation as Coal Screen Man. 1901 Census list Charles as a
          Brakes Man(?) Above. Charles died April 26, 1928 and is buried in
          Blaina Cemetery with wife Catherine and daughter, Elizabeth Maud.

          Of interest is that mother, Catherine, (Dec 18, 1908) and daughter,
          Elizabeth Maud, (Dec 15, 1908) died within 3 days of the other. Also
          of interest is that Gathorne Morgan was both Elizabeth Maud’s sibling
          (1889-1893) and son’s (6 Aug 1906-1984) name. !921 Wales Census list
          Gathorne Porter as a collier helper at age 15. England and Wales,
