          <p>
            When Henry A Pritchard was born on June 23, 1848, in Llanelly,
            Breconshire, Wales, his father, George, was 34 and his mother,
            Elizabeth (Jenkins), was 21. George and Elizabeth were married March
            13, 1847 in the Llanelly Parish Church. On July 24,1834, at the age
            of 20, George was convicted of being rogue and a vagabond and
            sentenced to 3 calendar months of hard labor. In 1842, at the
            recorded age of 28, George was convicted of assault and sentenced to
            12 months imprisonment. George worked as a puddler. Henry had 6
            brothers:

          </ul>
          <p>
            For many years, he was employed as a puddler. He worked at Bethlehem
            Steel Company until he was 76. 1930 United States Census list Henry
            living with Arthur and Emma Snyder at 310 Grand Street, Danville,
            PA. He died on April 12 (daughter Kim&apos;s Birthday), 1932, in
            Danville, Pennsylvania, at the age of 80 at the home of his
            daughter, Mrs. Arthur K. Snyder. Cause of death was Acute Cardiac
            Dilatation with contributory Myocarditis and other. Gene Snyder told
            me that when Henry died he was embalmed in the bathroom and placed
            in a room in the house. A family member sat with his body. Gene said
            he was too young (born in 1925), but his brothers (Born1910 & 1916)
            took their turn sitting with Henry&apos;s body and Gene would poke
            his head in the room.

            William was born in Llanelly, Breconshire, Wales. The 1871 Wales
            Census shows William&apos;s occupation as a puddler. He married
            Sarah Ann in 1874. Their daughter Sarah Jane was born on March 23,
            1878, in Ebbw Vale, Monmouthshire, Wales. In the 1881 Census, John
            (Driller Iron), Lewis (Driller), and James (Baller) are listed as
            boarders in William&apos;s household. I found in the Wales Census
            that living as a boarder or lodger, usually in a family members
            household to be common.
          </p>
          <p>
            William&apos;s occupation is “Baller Iron”. I found this on the
            internet-“A baller was a puddler who worked at a ball furnace in
            which iron or steel scrap or bars of puddled iron were treated to
            form an even purer wrought iron than is made from cast iron.”
          </p>
          <p>
            1891 Census shows William living with brother, James. 1901 Census
            shows William as the head of the household at 50, Sarah Ann, wife,
            age 47 and a daughter, Sarah Jane at age 23. On June 18, 1906, his
            daughter, Sarah Jane (Age 28), married a Cephas Gregg Mills (Age 28)
            in the Llanelly Parish Church. William worked as a furnace man at
            this time. Sarah Jane&apos;s daughter Phyllis Pritchard Mills was
            born in October 1906 in Bedwellty, Monmouthshire, Wales. Record show
            William buried on the 12th of February, 1929 in the Parish of
            Llanelly in the county of Brecon. He was 78 years old. William and
            Sarah Ann were married 55 years at the time of his death.

            Thomas was born about 1853 in Llanelly, Breconshire, Wales. 1881
            Wales Census list him as a boarder in the home of Benjamin
            Griffiths. Benjamin&apos;s wife&apos;s (Jane) maiden name was
            Jenkins. She was Elizabeth Jenkins&apos; sister, who was George
            Pritchard&apos;s wife. This makes Jane, Thomas&apos;s aunt. His
            occupation is Iron Puddler. He died in 1885 at the age of 32, and
            was buried in Rhymney, Monmouthshire, Wales on May 27.
          </p>

          <p>
            1871 Wales Census list Charles occupation as puddler. He was 15
            years old. Charles married Catherine Morgan (B. 1859) in 1878. Their
            children were Elizabeth Maud (1879–1908) and Gathorne Morgan
            (1889-1893). His son Gathorne Morgan passed away in 1893 at the age
            of 4. Daughter Elizabeth Maud passed away on December 15, 1908, at
            the age of 29. 1881 Wales Census list Charles and family as lodgers
            in the Thomas Jones household. Occupation is Puddler Iron. 1891
            Census lists his occupation as Coal Screen Man. 1901 Census list
            Charles as a Brakes Man(?) Above. Charles died April 26, 1928 and is
            buried in Blaina Cemetery with wife Catherine and daughter,
            Elizabeth Maud.
          </p>

          <p>
            Of interest is that mother, Catherine, (Dec 18, 1908) and daughter,
            Elizabeth Maud, (Dec 15, 1908) died within 3 days of the other. Also
            of interest is that Gathorne Morgan was both Elizabeth Maud&apos;s
            sibling (1889-1893) and son&apos;s (6 Aug 1906-1984) name. 1921

            to this country. Mr. (Art) Snyder states that her name was Jane.”
            Mr. Gene Snyder told me his mother (Emma) corresponded with a sister

            (1916-2012), and Eugene Warren (1925-2021)) with Arthur Keifer
            Snyder between 1910 and 1925. Her son Arthur lived next to my
            parents.

            Once when I was shoveling the sidewalk in front of my parents&apos;
            house, Art was shoveling his sidewalk. We talked and he told me he
            didn&apos;t expect to live this long. He might have been in his mid
            80s. Art was married to Isabel Alvarette Boyer and she was his
            second wife. His first wife being Mary P. Speicher (M. 22 Nov 1939).
            With Mary, Art had a son, Arthur George born in 1945. George was the
            name of Mary&apos;s father. The 1950 Census shows Arthur George
            living with his grandparents at 310 Grand Street. He is shown as
            being 6 years old. Art&apos;s cousin believed Art was raised by his
            grandparents. The cousin did not know the reason, but said Art was
            always there when they visited the grandparents. The cousin also
            said that Art was in the Marine Corps for four years. Arthur George
            was accepted by Florida Presbyterian College and was in the first
            freshman class to use the college&apos;s new bayside (Boca Ciera
            Bay) campus. Art passed away in April 2024.

            Gene was a history teacher in the Danville High School, head track
            coach, and assistant football coach. Dad’s first cousin, Gene,
            married Mary Frances McCarty. They had a son, Gene Jr., and a
            daughter, Sue. Gene Jr. and I were born in August, 1950. Sue and my
            sister Lisa were born in June, 1960. Gene Jr. had two sons, Michael
            and Stephen. My 2 sons are Michael and Steven. In both families,
            Michael is the oldest son. Gene Sr. was a member of the American
            Legion in Danville and I saw him there with his son. We often spoke
            of family history. Gene told me what I had heard before that when
            Henry and Anne came to the United States, a daughter remained in
            Wales. Gene said that Aunt Emma corresponded with this sister until
            the end of WWII. He also said that his brother Art recalled her name
            being Jane. Aunt Emma died on June 2, 1967, at Gold Star Nursing
            Home in Milton, PA at the age of 77. Cause was cerebral thrombosis
            due to arteriosclerosis. Other significant condition was diabetic
            mellitus. I remember driving Pop to Milton to visit his sister. I
            believe Dad owned a blue Chevy station wagon at the time. Aunt Emma
            and Uncle Art are buried in Fairview Cemetery directly behind Harry
            and Mae.

            <span class="fs-4 fw-bold">David John</span> was born on March 22,
            1894, in Danville, Pennsylvania. Henry and Anne resided at 206 Rough
            & Ready (now Iron) Street at that time and I believe Uncle Dave was
            probably born at home. “… Rough and Ready Mill on Railroad Street,
            where TRW’s plant would later stand.” He lived more than 50 years in
            Bloomsburg and worked for Standard Oil Co. for 27 years. Eugene
            (Gene) Snyder told me that Uncle Dave was a big man and worked as a
            bouncer at the “Bloody Bucket” in Danville. “People in the Bloody
            Third (Ward) were poor.” “They were hard working and hard drinking
            people, but on Saturday night we would all go to the Continental
            Hose Company for a block party. They would close off the street and
            everybody would dance.” I remember Uncle Dave driving from
            Bloomsburg to visit with Pop. At the time of his death, he was
            married to the former Pauline Mable Rehm. His obituary list 3
            daughters surviving him, but their maiden name in all 3 cases is
            Fegley. Pauline was previously married to Lee R. Fegley and they had
            3 daughters; Mary E., Phyllis D., and Shirley I. It list a stepson,
            Gene Merrit (Skip) Leiby born February 21, 1915. He was the son of
            John Ambrose & Della A Leiby. On the website findagrave.com the bio
            reads “his (Gene Merrit) parents were married a very short time. His
            mother remarried to David Pritchard in about 1924.” I (David L.
            Klees) was told by one of Eugene Leiby's first cousins that his
            mother had him out-of-wedlock and eventually married David
            Pritchard. Also on the website is written “TSgt US ARMY WWII, 25th
            Quartermaster, War Dog Platoon, 1 Jul 1943 - 16 Nov 1945”. “Mr.
            Leiby was former treasurer of the Bloomsburg Fair and had been a
            fair officer for 20 years.” Gene Leiby was married to Freda M.
            Nevel. Her bio reads “She also assisted her late husband in the
            office at the Bloomsburg Moose Club and also the treasurer's office
            at the Bloomsburg Fair.” Gene Leiby is buried in the Vets Lot, Elan
            Memorial Park, Lime Ridge. Uncle Dave married Anna (possibly
            Rodella) Della Leiby on May 1, 1924 in Sunbury, PA. Della passed
            away September 17, 1939 in Bloomsburg. Uncle Dave died August 31,
            1984 (age 90) and is buried in Lot F32, New Rosemont Cemetery, Espy,
            Scott Township, Columbia County, Pennsylvania. Information was
            provided by Wilt Funeral Home in Bloomsburg and is on “Record of
            Burial Place of Veteran”. Wilt Funeral Home was owned & operated by
            Donald Wilt (Lot G39 (known as Wilt Circle), New Rosemont Cemetery),
            grandson of Margaret Lucille Pfahler.

            was born on February 24, 1892, in Danville, Pennsylvania. Pop
            completed his education with the 5th grade. On Wednesday evening,
            July 1, 1914, Pop and Grandma (Miss May Morgan) were married by the
            Rev. Dr. James Wallaston Kirk in the Mahoning Presbyterian Church,
            Danville. The Danville Morning News article reported “Both the
            contracting parties are well-known and esteemed young people of this
            city.”

          <p>
            Registration Card dated June 5, 1917 lists their residence as E.
            Front Street, Danville. Pop was a laborer for Danville Iron & Steel
            Co. Physical description is medium height and weight. Card states
            there is a wife and 2 children under 12 dependent on him for
            support. In the 1930 Census, Pop&apos;s occupation is iron worker
            and residence is Cooper Street. World War II Draft Registration Card
            (1942) lists residence as 31 Cherry Street, Danville. Employer is
            Kennedy Van Saun Mfg. & Eng Corp, Beaver Street, Danville. Pop is
            listed as 5&apos; 7” and approx. 157 Lbs. Pop died January 26, 1978.
          </p>

          <p>
            Gene Snyder Sr. told me this story. Pop lived on Cooper Street at
            the time and when the river came up, he would come to his sister
            Emma&apos;s house on Grand Street. Pop would often go to the
            basement at Emma&apos;s house to check the water level. Mae said to
            Emma-you know what your brother is doing. Pop was sampling Uncle
            Art&apos;s home brew. Gene said he didn&apos;t know why his dad made
            the brew as his dad didn&apos;t drink.

            Among the memories of Pop are that he walked often. Some walks took
            him from his home at 9 Factory Street past our house on Grand
            Street. I believe he may have gone to the Washies Playground and
            perhaps the Danville State Hospital before heading home. Other walks
            took him downtown. Once he told me he is up in the morning, walks
            downtown, comes home and does the laundry before Mae gets up.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pop spent time at the Danville Water Works, which was down from his
            house. He would sit in front of the building with some of the
            workers and drink a Coke. He also spent time on the bench in the
            park next to the river bridge.
          </p>
          <p>
            I shoveled snow from their sidewalk. Other than snow days off from
            school, another time was Christmas Eve. Growing up it often snowed
            for Christmas. We stopped at Pop and Grandma&apos;s on the way home
            from the farm (mother&apos;s homestead) on Christmas Eve. He had a
            steel snow shovel which made the snow more than twice as heavy. I
            have that shovel to this day.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another job I had was nailing wooden siding on the yard side of the
            shanty. Pop supervised and often told me to hammer another nail into
            the board. I told Dad that some places were more steel than wood
            because of the number of nails. (Exaggerated) Dad said Pop wanted to
            be sure it didn’&apos;t come down.
          </p>
          <p>
            I can&apos;t recall where I saw the picture, but it was Pop at the
            bar in the Riverview Hotel. My father told me Pop stopped drinking
            at 50. He had enjoyed Christmas Eve that year. When Dad visited
            Christmas Day, Pop told him to take the whiskey and beer; that he
            was done drinking. It is my understanding that Pop drank Old
            Overholt Rye Whiskey. When dad and I cleaned out the house on 9
            Factory Street, there were bottles of homemade wine. Dad said it
            would have been vinegar at that time.
          </p>
          <p>
            The back porch at 9 Factory Street faced the river, which was less
            than a block away. Dad said Pop would watch the “bums” stash their
            bottle along the river. Pop would then take the bottle and enjoy
            watching them look for the bottle when they returned.
          </p>
          <p>
            As appearing elsewhere, people were often paid with goods during the
            depression. Dad said Pop worked at times for a farmer up the river
            towards Catawissa. Pop got there by rowboat on the river. On this
            day Pop was paid with a bottle of wine. Dad was playing with friends
            along the river and one of them asked Dad if that wasn&apos;t their
            boat floating on the river. It was with Pop asleep in the boat. He
            had drank the bottle of wine.
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe a lot of time was spent on the river. When my dad got a
            12&apos; aluminum rowboat, we rowed to the islands up river towards
            Catawissa. On the island was a poor grade of coal; maybe even slate.
            Dad said when he was growing up, they would fill their boat with
            this coal and take it home to burn.
          </p>
          <p>
            When Pop had the stroke, he walked up the hill to Dr. Curry&apos;s
            office and said something was wrong. Dr. Curry said Mr. Pritchard,
            you had a stroke. Eventually Pop got to be too much for Grandma to
            handle and he went to a nursing home in Bloomsburg. On a visit, Pop
            pointed out an employee to my wife and I and said she was “meaner
            than cat shit”.
          </p>

            Of interest are the following (1) great grandfather Henry had six
            brothers; (2) William, a brother, had a daughter (Sarah Jane) who
            married and had a daughter; (3) Thomas appears to have never
            married, living with his aunt and dying at 32; (4) John never
            married; (5) Charles had a son and daughter with his first wife. The
            son died at age 4 and the daughter at 29. No spouse found for the
            daughter. Charles has a step daughter with his second wife, who
            inherited his estate. (6)Lewis had 2 sons and a daughter. No
            children found for any of the three. (7) No wife or children are
            found for James. James died at 51. Of the 5 known children of Henry
            and Anne, (1) George died young; (2) Uncle Dave never had any
            children of his own; (3) 2 sons of Elizabeth&apos;s 3 children died
            young of tuberculosis at ages 5 and 25; (4) Aunt Emma had 3 sons
            with Arthur Kiefer Snyder; and (5) Pop had 2 sons, Uncle Harry and
            dad. There was little chance of carrying on this line of the
            Pritchards, even though there were possibilities starting with the 7
            Pritchard men .

            grammy completed the 8th grade for her education. She had two sons
            and four daughters with Harry Evan Pritchard between 1915 and 1927;

            On Friday nights we visited my parents and Dad and I went to the
            clubs. Before going home Dad & I stopped to fix the coal fires for
            Little Grammy. There was one in the living room and the kitchen
            stove. There was never heat in the upstairs bedrooms; only a space
            heater in the bathroom. During the day, the two doors leading to the
            first floor hallway were closed to keep the heat downstairs. The
            open stairs for the second floor were in this hallway. Anyways
            during these stops, Little Grammy had some sharp comments for my
            Dad. Once she told Dad she was surprised his stomach didn&apos;t rot
            out considering what he ate (Hot Peppers, etc.). On another
            occasion, Dad asked what happened to Grandpa Morgan&apos;s money.
            Little Grammy responded with he drank it away just like you.

            William Gad Morgan was born 17 September 1850 the eldest son of
            Daniel (1824-1891) and Mary Jane (Ephlin) in Danville, Pennsylvania.
            Siblings were James D., Joseph Henry, John Peter, George Burlingame,
            Dan, Robert Seer, and John. The 1860 US Federal Census list the
            birthplace of William, Joseph, John Peter, George, and Dan as
            England. Joseph Henry married Isabella (Bella) James (Born May, 1852
            in New York) on April 12,1885 in Saugerties, New York. They were the
            parents of a son, James C. (1888-1975). James married Harriet
            (Hattie) M. Lacy on 23 Nov 1910. My cousin shows 2 judgements filed
            against Joseph Henry by Isabella E. Morgan. My cousin writes that
            “she (Isabella E.) was probably a relative, but I cannot place her”.
            I believe it could very well have been his wife. I found a few
            versions of Isabella&apos;s name, which creates confusion. Most
            often she is referred to as Belle or Bella James. My cousin&apos;s
            write-up reads “not been able to find any trace of Joseph since
            1897.” The 1900 US Federal Census shows Joseph, Belle, and James
            residing in Saugerties, Ulster, New York. It list his occupation as
            a machinist and his birth year as 1850 (?). Joseph Henry died 23
            September 1902 in Saugerties, Ulster, New York, USA. I believe the
            Joseph Henry given here is Daniel Morgan&apos;s son. John Peter died
            when he was 9 years old in 1864. His brother also named John was
            born in Danville, June 14, 1865. Dan died at age 2 (10 Oct 1858-2
            Apr 1861) and is buried in Mt. Vernon Cemetery, Riverside, PA along
            with John Peter, James D. and parents, Daniel & Mary Jane. James D.
            was 5 months old when he died. The grave markers were found worn and
            broken. Some nearby wood ash was rubbed on James D.&apos;s marker
            and the following was read-James D. (Line 1), Dan and Jane Morgan
            (Line 2), Died March 10, 1869 (Line 3), Aged 0 years (Line 4), 5
            months _ days (Line 5). There is a small, white marker to the left
            of Dan&apos;s marker, which might be Mary Jane&apos;s head stone. It
            is worn and unreadable. My cousin writes that there was a headstone
            with “Mother” on it in the plot with Daniel and sons, but the dates
            did not match. The 1920 US Federal Census shows Mary Jane at age 88
            a patient in Geisinger Hospital. Jane may have been 90 as other
            Census and Death Certificate list 1830 as her year of birth and not
            1832. Among other patients listed is Abigail Geisinger, age 97. Mary
            Jane died November 22, 1922 at the age of 92. Certificate of Death
            list the cause as chronic myocarditis. At her death she had been a
            resident of the State Hospital for the Insane, Danville, PA since
            July 8, 1921 (Ref. Death Certificate). Cousin reports July 21, 1921.
            Robert&apos;s middle name, Seer, is his grandmother&apos;s (Jane
            Seer) maiden name. I have found this practice a few times. Robert
            (1860-July 6, 1933) of Milton married Mary A. Ritter (1865-July 14,
            1948) of Muncy on Wednesday, January 22, 1908 by Rev. John Stech.
            Newspaper reported that both were well known in Danville and that
            Robert was formerly employed at the Reading Iron Works.
            Robert&apos;s death certificate reports his death in Hartley
            Township and burial in Watsontown. Borough records show Robert and
            Mary buried in Section 7, Plot 33, Spaces 4 & 5 of the old cemetery.
            Borough records show the plot being owned by Peter Gardner. Record
            shows No Perpetual Care, No Annual Care, and No Heirs. No deed was
            found for the lot. No relationship between Peter Gardner and the
            Morgans is found. There are 2 stone markers that read “Father” and
            “Mother” where the Morgans are buried. No record of the Morgans
            having children was found. Mary was 43 when they married. Borough
            records list a Brick Vault for Robert and a Plain Vault for Mary. A
            third marker is in the plot. It reads “Brother”. Borough records
            show Ruth Betty Noll buried in this 3rd space. Ruth died 7/19/1948.
            Borough shows no grave opening. Death certificate list Norman as her
            husband and her maiden name as Greiner, Charles Greiner as father,
            DOB as Nov 3, 1913 and residence as Watsontown, RD #2. There are 5
            vacant spaces in Plot 33. Ties to Peter Gardner or the Morgans are
            not found for Mrs. Noll. William Gad married Ida Savage (also found
            it spelled Savidge) on August 16, 1871. Ida was the mother of Jennie
            (1872&#8209;1958), Dan (1874&#8209;1924), Joseph (1875&#8209;1935),
            and Mae (Grandmother) (1895&#8209;1983). Note the 20 years
            difference in Grammy&apos;s birth from Joseph&apos;s. The dates show
            Ida being 16 when Jennie was born and 39 when Grammy was born. Ida
            passed on 30, September 1903 and is buried in the Episcopal Cemetery
            in Danville. Cause of death was breast cancer. Ida is buried next to
            her sister, Esther Stoes. Parents Elizabeth and Charles Savidge are
            also buried there. According to my cousin, Esther&apos;s death
            record shows “she also died from an operation for breast cancer.”
            Esther died in 1907. Esther was the wife of William F. Stoes, who
            had Stoes Coronet Band in Danville. On April 23, 1907, William Gad
            married Isabelle C. Curry. Her maiden name was Campbell and her
            first husband had died. Pat Peters shows her first husband being
            Martin Curry and his place of internment as St. Joseph Cemetery.
            Pat&apos;s information on his burial is from a record in the office
            of the Clerk of Orphans Court and also appears in Martin&apos;s
            Newspaper Obituary. Using findagrave.com, I could not find him in
            St. Joseph Cemetery; nor have I found a marker in the cemetery. The
            Obituary shows a large number in attendance from out of town for the
            funeral. I found a Martin F. Curry married to Margaret O&apos;Brien
            and living on Nicholas Ave, Danville in 1900. My research found a
            McWilliams Curry as a possibly Isabelle&apos;s first husband. With
            the help of the caretaker at the Odd Fellows Cemetery in Danville, a
            marker for McWilliams Curry was found. Cemetery records show
            Isabelle buried next to McWilliams, with no marker. This agrees with
            her Newspaper Obituary which reads “Internment will be in the Odd
            Fellows Cemetery”. Isabelle died in the infirmary of the Danville
            State Hospital according to her obituary. Odd Fellows and St Joseph
            cemeteries are located next to each other. William Gad died 18
            November 1930 in Danville, Montour, Pennsylvania, USA. Death
            Certificate shows William Gad buried in the Episcopal Cemetery in
            Danville. The website, findagrave.com, shows William Morgan (Died
            1851) and William G. Morgan (17 Sep 1850 - 18 Nov 1930) being buried
            in the Episcopal Cemetery. Website reports church records showing
            William Morgan being 57 years old at time of death. Also says there
            is no marker. I also found no marker for William G. I made contact
            with Christ Memorial Episcopal Church, 120 E. Market St., Danville
            and Danville genealogical society, but was unable to find more
            information. I believe it is possible William G. is buried next to
            Ida Savage as there appears to be an open space. The other William
            is William Gad&apos;s grandfather. The age and date found in
            ancestry.com match the church records. The grandfather, William
            (died 1851) had a son, William, who died 3 years (1854) after his
            dad.

          <p>A second son, Daniel, died 22 December 1924.</p>
          <p>
            Daniel Morgan had sister, Esther (Born 1829), who married Michael
            Graham (2 years younger). Michael & Esther had a daughter,
            Elizabeth, who married William Henry Hilands. He was “a well known
            resident”, who lived near Montandon, PA. Surviving William H. was a
            son, Thomas Paul. Thomas married the former Kathryn Apollo. He
            operated Hilands Cannery on North Sixth Street in Lewisburg, from
            1946 until his retirement in 1954. The cannery was the former
            Lewisburg Manufacturing plant. Before the cannery, Thomas was a
            trucker and operator of a rendering plant near Montandon. The
            cannery was prompted when the federal government urged the growing
            and canning of more vegetables for use by the armed services. Thomas
            Paul & Kathryn had a son, Thomas Richard. During Thomas R.&apos;s
            life, he was a disc jockey, a local sports anchor, into real estate,
            and a medical tourism entrepreneur.

            Through this search, I have found numerous cousins in Grandma
            Morgan&apos;s line. I don&apos;t remember contact with this side,
            probably in part due to the 20 years difference between Grandma and
            her youngest sibling. Most resided in the Milton area.

            Starting with Joseph Morgan, he was born 16 September 1875 in
            Danville. He married Bertha Moll December 6, 1900. They had 6
            children: Hurley (1903-1974), Florence M. (1905-1985), Thelma
            (1908-1908), Joe (1910-1983), and twins, John & Mary, (1916-1916).
          </p>
          <p>
            Hurley married Edna Estella Miller and she gave birth to James
            Hurley (1937-1965), Mollie Elaine (1/10/1941-1/21/1941), and Thomas
            William (1946). Hurley and Edna are buried with James Hurley and
            Molly Elaine in Harmony Cemetery, Milton, PA-Plot J. James Hurley
            died in a plane crash in Mendon, Vermont. Thomas William was a
            teacher and vice principal at the Milton High School. I remember
            attending a college football game with Tom Morgan and Bill Snyder at
            Bloomsburg. My wife, Cyndee, once worked at the Milton HS and said
            she used to go on doughnut runs in the driver&apos;s ed car. Once
            she couldn&apos;t get the standard transmission in reverse and Tom
            came to help. Bill Snyder told me that Tom was a good basketball
            player in high school along with Mike Butler (cousin&apos;s
            brother-in-law).

            Florence May married Oren Vastine Ravert. They were parents of Betty
            Jean (1927-2004), Nelson O. (1928), Raymond R. (1933), and Bonnie

            to ACF, he operated Tydol Service Station on South Front Street in
            Milton. He worked the family owned business with his sons Robert &
            Donald. At his passing, Joe, age 72, lived with his companion, Mrs.
            Frances D. Price Yon, 907 Elm Street, Watsontown. He was survived by
            his wife and 4 sons in addition to Mrs. Yon, 6 grandchildren, 3
            great grandchildren, and a sister, Mrs. Florence Ravert. Robert A.,
            Betty J. (wife), and M. Thelma (mother) are buried together in the
            Milton Cemetery (Headstone found in Section 5, Lot 40. Joe is buried
            in the Milton Cemetery (Section 5, Lot 41 to the right of Lot 40)

            Donald B. (1930-2022) graduated from the Williamsport Technical
            Institute. He retired from Amp Inc. in Harrisburg with 30 years of
            service. He was married to Marion Esther Forbes on August 26, 1950
            until her passing May 4, 1993. Donald would later marry Margaret
            Ruth Markley, who passed Dec 9, 2010 at the Masonic Village in
            Elizabethtown, PA where she resided with Donald since 2004. He was a
            veteran of the Korean War serving with the 28th Division of the
            Pennsylvania National Guard. Donald&apos;s design for Milton&apos;s
            sesquicentennial logo in 1967 later became the official seal for the
            Borough.

            The next sibling of Grandma Morgan was Daniel Morgan. In 1896, he
            married Jenny Wells Young, who later married Arthur E. Beaver. I
            believe this was the result of Daniel&apos;s death in 1924. Jenny
            was 2 years younger and her passing came in 1950 (26 years later).
            Daniel and Jenny were parents of Helen I. (1895-1986), Ethel A.
            (1902-1982), and Stuart (Stewart) Dan Morgan (1909-1980).

            A recent obituary appearing in the Daily Item (Online) read Helen L.
            (Sealy) Steeley had passed away on Tuesday, December 21, 2021 at the
            age of 94. Helen was married to Donald L. Steeley, whose mother was

            cousin. Helen and Donald are buried in Fairview Cemetery,
            Montgomery, PA. A nearby marker is for their son, David, who passed
            away in 1992 at the age of 36. Surviving Helen L. are a grandson,
            Bradley Ramos, nieces and nephews; Jean Miller, William Bennett,

            Ethel married Harry Irvin Trate (1900-1962) on August 6, 1921. Their
            daughter Ruth E. lived from December 25, 1925 to January 12, 2001
            and is buried with her husband, Fred E. Snyder, in the Montandon
            Cemetery. They were married March 12, 1948 in Richmond, Virgnia. A
            son, Karl I. (Nickname “Spud”), was born to Ethel and Harry about
            May 15, 1924 and is pictured in the high school yearbook with the
            1941 Milton football team. Karl completed a questionnaire for the
            American Baseball Bureau in Chicago, Illinois in which he wrote his
            most unusual experience in baseball was “Losing a ball-game by a
            score of 1-0. Yet not giving up any hits.” Karl married Marcella L.
            Williams on 24 September 1949 and they are buried in Twin Hills
            Cemetery (Lot 180, JFK (Chapel Lawn)) in Muncy, PA.

            Susan Mae was born on February 16, 1958. She has one daughter with
            Richard P. Hine. Marriage license is dated December 19, 1975. Her
            daughter Jaime was born in July 1976. Sue married Dennis Oeschger
            Barnhart in November 1985. Sue had 2 sons with Barney-Jared Evan
            (1986) and Tylor (1992). In 2009, Tylor was invited to run in 2
            races (an All American 5K and an international 6K) in Queensland,
            Australia. Once when dad had a hospital visit, he saw Sue going into
            Fosse Clinic. He talked to her while I parked the car. She was in a
            wheel chair and I believe she had lost a leg. She lived on Mahoning
            Street in Danville and was walking the dog across the bridge, which
            goes to the high school, when her leg got tangled in the dog leash.
            I&apos;ve been told she now lives in Florida.

            I remember a Christmas Eve around my senior year in high school when
            Uncle Harry and Theron Laubach were visiting dad and drinking. They
            decided to use free weights, which were setup in the shanty. Another
            time dad and I visited Uncle Harry and had a beer. I don&apos;t
            believe Uncle Harry drank much and the beer had been in the
            refrigerator for awhile. Another memory is walking from dad&apos;s
            to Geisinger to visit Uncle Harry when he was hospitalized with
            cancer. He was sedated, probably to live with the pain. But it was a
            good visit in that the conversation made sense.

            Aunt Dot worked as a clerk. She was employed at Cain&apos;s
            Pharmacy, Woolworth&apos;s, Coles Hardware and Dora Dale&apos;s in
            Danville. Residence was 115 E Front Street, Danville, PA. Aunt Dot

            Home. Uncle Albert died 5 days later on August 24, 2006. Her and
            Uncle Albert are buried in Mount Vernon Cemetery, Riverside, PA.
            According to my memory, Uncle Albert was buried in his son
            Dave&apos;s suit (a mistake), which hung in the closet on Front
            Street. It is my understanding that Uncle Albert worked two jobs
            when Dave and Rich were in college. Uncle Albert served the Danville
            Elks Lodge as Chaplin 1961, Trustee, and Exalted Ruler 1965 & 1966.

            Memories here were visits on Christmas Eves. When we were young,
            Rich got a chemistry set, which we played with in their basement. On
            visits, Uncle Albert was usually sitting in a chair in the corner of
            the living room smoking a cigaret. He was a Yankee baseball fan.
            Rich and I friended around when I was in high school. At times it
            involved Rich&apos;s friend, Rich Hackenburg, who lived on Ferry
            Street about 1 block away. Cousin Rich and I lifted free weights in
            our backyard. He corrected the way I was doing bicep curls. We spent
            a lot of time in the summer playing Canasta, a card game. I remember
            Dave going to Millersville College to study Math.

            Memories here were also visits on Christmas Eves. Visits to
            dad&apos;s siblings were mostly at Christmas. In their senior years
            dad saw more of his sisters. Uncle Harry had passed on. When
            visiting, Uncle Bob watched TV in a room in the back of the house
            and Aunt Emma was watching TV in the living room in the front of the
            house. Uncle Bob did woodworking. He made a grandfather clock. He
            lost fingers using his power tools. Uncle Bob took me to a cabin
            where he was a member for the first day of deer. This was before I
            could hunt by myself. Another hunter in camp shot a deer and I was
            asked to put my tag on the deer so that the hunter could continue to
            hunt. I said no. I wanted to hunt with dad the following Saturday.

            Nov., 20 Dec., & 27 Dec. An article in the Danville Morning News
            dated 22 Dec 1947, Monday, reports the wedding taking place Saturday
            afternoon. This would have been 20 Dec. The article also reports
            that the bride was given away by her brother, William E. Pritchard.

            There were Pritchard family reunions at Knoebel&apos;s Grove. I
            remember current events being a topic of conversation. Uncle Bill
            read magazines such as Time and Newsweek and newspaper(s). The last
            time I saw Aunt Phyllis was when mom died. She visited dad at our
            house. I spoke with her on the phone when dad passed away. She said
            at the time that Uncle Bill was not well. He died March 1, 2011 and
            his ashes were buried at sea per his request.

            <span class="fs-4 fw-bold">William Eugene</span> was born March
            14,1923, the 4th of 5 children in Danville, Montour County,
            Pennsylvania. On September 11, 1948, the Rev. Frank L. Pohl united
            in marriage William and Catherine Marcella Tobias at St. Joseph
            Catholic Church in Milton, Pennsylvania. On the 2nd of September,
            1954, they purchased the home at 219 Grand Street, Danville from
            Harold A. and Martha C. Evans of Bloomsburg, Columbia County,
            Pennsylvania in consideration of the sum of $7,000. Dad was a good
            athlete, playing baseball, football, and basketball. A cousin writes
            that dad was captain of the football and basketball teams. I
            remember him telling me that he was captain of the football team. He
            told me, that when he played, the captain called the plays on
            offense and not the quarterback. I believe he did some boxing at the
            YMCA, bowled in 2 men&apos;s leagues and a mixed league, and never
            lost to me in pool. Once when dad & I visited the Washies Fire
            Company, a man stepped up and showed me a scar. He said dad gave it
            to him boxing at the YMCA. Dad was one of the Danville basketball
            players of the &apos;40s honored at halftime of a
            Danville-Bloomsburg basketball game. The newspaper article was
            February 16, 1960 (20 years later). When dad played basketball, the
            coach wanted the ball worked in under the basket. Dad said he heard
            from the coach when he took an outside shot. In baseball, he played
            for the Washies entry to the Tri-County League. His nickname was
            “Catawissa Arm”. In the Sports Whirl column of the Danville News
            dated 4/20/1993 is written “… memories of yesteryear days when the
            Danville State Hospital fielded the greatest semi-pro teams in the
            Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.” Dad was 1 of 11 names remembered
            among “some of the great players of that era …”. While playing for
            the high school football team, he scored a 95-yard touchdown run of
            a fumble recovery to beat Freeland 12-7. The Morning News, Danville
            reported that as Pritchard reached the 35 yard line, he was
            “menaced”, but sophomore guard Gene Snyder and senior tackle Orval
            Karchner “cut down” the would be tacklers. Talking to Gene Snyder at
            the Legion about this game, he said he was telling Dad to lateral
            the football to him. Gene told me that when he went out for football
            it was at the running back position, but he thought he had a better
            chance to play at guard. When F.Q. Hartman Field was demolished, an
            article ran in the Press Enterprise, Bloomsburg of the 10 most
            memorable plays and this fumble recovery and run for touchdown was
            number two on the list. A cousin writes that Pop described dad as
            wiry. Pop said that meant dad was tough as twisted wire. Dad was
            employed at the Danville State Hospital until about 1958. At that
            time Dad was hired by the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) in the clothing
            industry at the Lewisburg Federal Penitentiary (Max Security). Dad
            was older than the maximum age for new hires and worked past the
            then mandatory retirement age of 50. Dad retired as Manager of the
            Clothing Industry. During Dad&apos;s employment, there was a strike
            by the prisoners. Dad worked a longer day during the strike. The
            prisoners were individually escorted to and from meals. Once Dad was
            showing a prisoner how to press clothing and got his hand sandwiched
            between the two surfaces of the press burning his hand. On one
            vacation, Dad went to the prison to pick up his pay. He took me
            along and gave me a look see of the prison behind the wall. There
            were prison cells much like college dormitory rooms. The free
            weights lifted in the exercise yard were huge. I had not seen that
            much weight on a bar and couldn&apos;t guess the amount. In the
            clothing industry, I was told that the BOP had a contract with an
            outside service to repair the sewing machines. However, the
            servicemen supplied the tools and Dad fixed the machine. I remember
            Dad fixing sewing machines for Mrs. Mausteller and Mrs. Livziey in
            the neighborhood. There are similarities between Dad and my life. We
            both married farmer&apos;s daughter. Our wives are 4 years younger.
            Our wives first name begins with the letter “C”-Catherine and
            Cyndee. Dad was 25 when married in 1948. I turned 25 in the year I
            was married, although later in the year. We were married 2 years
            when our first was born and it was a boy.

            <span class="fs-4 fw-bold">Marian Kay (Pritchard) Everett</span> was
            the second child born to William and Catherine Pritchard on August
            31,1951. In high school she was Class Secretary and played both
            basketball and softball. She was the Sophmore and Junior Class
            Secretary. The Danville News 2 Nov 1968 ran a picture of Marian
            being crowned Danville High School Color Queen 1968. After
            graduation, Marian was employed as a secretary by Kennedy Van Saun
            in Danville. On Saturday, July 24, 1971 Marian married Edward A.
            Everett at St. Joseph Church in Danville with Father Francis Bach
            performing the double ring ceremony. They celebrated their 50th
            Anniversary on September 11, 2021. Marian and Ed raised Dr. Edward
            A. Everett Jr and Laurie Kay. They have 7 grandchildren. Being a
            year and 2 days younger, Marian and I grew up together. When we were
            young we often heard that we fought like cats and dogs. Growing up I
            played with toy soldiers and cowboys and Indians. When I had them
            setup, Marian would knock them down and we would fight. We went to
            the Washies Playground and Sunnybrook Park. There would be a list of
            chores hanging in the shanty for Marian and I to do before we could
            go anywhere. One summer Marian and I took a bucket of water and a
            rag to the basement to wash the dust off the air ducts. In the late
            summer we picked from the vegetable garden at the house and the
            farm. Mom would take us for a car ride after school in the fall to
            pick black walnuts. Days later when the walnut turned from green to
            black, Marian and I would sit in the basement with heavy rubber
            gloves and remove the hull (outer shell). We would then crack the
            nut open with a hammer and pick out the nutmeat. In the Danville
            News, 19 Oct 1962 is written “Marian Pritchard gave a piano solo, …”
            at the regular meeting of the Second Ward PTA. We shopped for
            Christmas presents for Mom & Dad. I remember buying a jewelry box
            for Mom at Bea Butler and a weather gauge for Dad that showed
            temperature and barometric pressure. We went to dances at the YMCA
            and Marian would walk home with a boyfriend. We also attended dances
            at Knoebels Grove in the summertime and at St. Joseph&apos;s Church.

            <span class="fs-4 fw-bold">Jane Louise (Pritchard) Reedy </span>was
            born July 31,1957 to William and Catherine. In High School Jane was
            a Band Member (Flag Squad), Chorus, FHA, Senior Business Club, and
            in the Spanish Club. She married Thomas Eugene Reedy on Friday,
            April 21, 1978 at St. Joseph Church in Milton, PA with Father Martin
            Brown performing the ceremony. Jane graduated from Danville
            Practical Nursing (LPN) School on October 31 and is employed by
            Geisinger Medical Center. Children were Thomas E. Jr., Rebecca
            (Reedy) Smith, and Marcus. They have 9 grandchildren. Jane was 7
            years younger, so when I graduated High School and went to college,
            Jane was finishing elementary school. In the 1960s and 1970s, The
            Danville News ran a column on the happenings at the Washies
            Playground. Jane and Lisa are named in many of these articles for
            Miss Washies, Tom Thumb Wedding, Hobo Picnic, Gus Kooher Day, and
            events such as Bingo, Skee-Ball, Sandbox Contest, Baby Show, and
            more. Jane was named Miss Washies Playground 1965. As part of the
            contest she had to write a paragraph on why she wanted to be Miss
            Washies. Jane wrote “I would like to be Miss Washies Playground
            because I don&apos;t know what I would do without the Playground. I
            meet a lot of new friends every summer. It&apos;s a nice place to
            play and make things. When I go to the playground, I get a lot of
            nickles and pennies to spend.” Jane had a dachshund named Fritzie.
            One Saturday Fritzie ran out into the street and was hit by a car.
            Dad rushed the dog to the vet. When I got married, I picked up Jane
            and Lisa at the house and they rode with me in the Firebird to
            Nebraska for the wedding.

            among the leading hitters, both in high school and Women&apos;s
            Slo-pitch Softball. She was married to Raymond Paul “Pete” Kline on
            May 9, 1987 at St. Joseph Catholic Church in Danville, PA by Pastor

            <span class="fs-4 fw-bold">William Eugene Pritchard Jr.</span> was
            born August 29, 1950. Month and day are same as Aunt Emily Snyder.
            On March 15, 1975, he married Cyndee Susan Dunivan in Tilden, NE.
            Together they were the proud parents of Michael Joseph (Born April
            26, 1977), Steven William (Sept. 5, 1979) and Kimberly Lynn (April
            12, 1983).
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="fs-4 fw-bold">Michael Joseph Pritchard</span> was a
            sports fan. Growing up, he played Baseball, Basketball, Football,
            and Soccer. Mike made all-star teams in the first 3 sports. In
            baseball, he pitched and played shortstop. I remember a night when
            he pitched a high school game and then we drove him to a Legion
            game, where he also pitched. In a teener league all-star game, the
            scorer came to the coach after the game and said Mike threw 165
            pitches in the game. His arm got tired, but he never had arm trouble
            until his senior year at Dayton. It is my understanding that an
            effort was made to add speed to the fastball which required a change
            in his delivery. He experienced shoulder and elbow problems. In
            basketball, he was among the best in the league in 3-point shooting.
            He was also above average in leaping ability. In his senior year he
            jumped center at the tipoff. At less than 6&apos;, he won the tip,
            but was the first to recover the ball. This was a turnover.
            Mike&apos;s first year in college was at Penn State Hazelton. In
            baseball he pitched and won the first playoff game at the end of the
            season. I attended with my Uncle Steve Valushin. After the game we
            had supper with Uncle Steve and Aunt Eleanor at their house. Michael
            transferred to the University of Dayton his second year of college.
            Of note in the 3 years at Dayton, Mike pitched in 40 games with a
            career record of 0-0. Had saves, but no decisions. He pitched mostly
            in relief with some starts. He was a team captain his senior year.
            Upon graduation from Dayton, Mike served 2 years as an assistant
            coach at Dayton. This was followed by three years at Hanover College
            in Indiana as pitching and outfield coach. Then starting in 2004
            there was 12 years as head coach at Centre College in Danville, KY.
            “In 2007 the Colonels qualified for the conference tournament for
            the first time in eight years. Centre then went 20-17 in 2008, which
            marked only the third time in school history a Centre team had won
            20 games or more in a season and the first winning season since
            2001. The 2009 season saw the Colonels qualify for their third
            straight conference tournament, where they finished third for the
            highest finish in SCAC Tournament history. The first win of that
            tournament was a 4-2 victory over the No. 2 team in the nation,
            Millsaps College, in the opening round.” At Centre he met and
            married Laura Coleman. He finished coaching as an assistant at
            Hanover College. Total years in coaching was shy of 20. He is now
            employed as a Wildlife Conservation Officer for the state of
            Kentucky.

            ><br />Michael Pritchard (Conservation Officer I) This award honors
            the state&apos;s Boating Law Enforcement Officer of the Year.
            Winners are chosen for outstanding service to the agency or state in
            any facet of recreational boating safety, including enforcement,
            education, search and rescue, outreach, innovation, accident
            investigation and heroic action. Michael patrolled six waterbodies
            in 2022: Herrington Lake, Taylorsville Lake, Cedar Creek Lake, the
            Kentucky River, Salt River and Elkhorn Creek. He issued citations
            for 18 boating related charges, assisted with 20 more, and conducted
            three boat accident investigations, all on Herrington Lake. In
            January 2022, he was certified in the NASBLA Boat Incident
            Investigation&#8209;Level 1 course. He then attended and received
            certification for the NASBLA BUI Train-The-Trainer course in March
            2022 and completed the Boat Instructor Training in May to assist as
            an instructor for future KDFWR academy classes. In other activities,
            Michael participated in the Mercer County Elementary School Fair,
            attended the Herrington Lake Conservation League meeting to answer
            and discuss boating safety questions and issues and was interviewed
            by FOX 56 about boating safety before Memorial Day weekend.

            <span class="fs-4 fw-bold">Steven William Pritchard</span> Grew up
            playing Baseball, Football, Basketball, Wrestling, Soccer, Cross
            Country and Track. Eventually he ran out of sports to try and not
            being good at any of them he arrived at the conclusion that his
            older brother Michael acquired all of the athletic DNA from the
            family gene pool leaving none for his younger brother. In 9th Grade,
            Steven was the backup quarterback on the football team. In a game at
            Central Columbia, he played the 1st half. I got to the game late and
            didn&apos;t see the 1st half, but the coach told me Steve did good.
            I remember a 3 point shot he made from the corner in basketball. His
            best sport was Track. Early on Steve ran the Relays and the 3200.
            His best was at the Javelin, where he finished 5th in the league
            meet. He threw javelin once in college at the Indiana University of
            PA. It was an open invitational. He also threw discus, shot put, and
            tried the pole vault once while in high school. I believe it was a
            summer job while in college that he worked for CATV-8 in Danville.
            While working for CATV-8, Steve made 2 8-track tapes of the Danville
            Iron Heritage Festival. Upon graduation, with his Communications
            degree, Steve was employed as a photo journalist for WNEP 16
            (Intern), WNBC 28 and WHPTV 21 in Harrisburg. At TV21, he was
            trained to operate the remote van and in the use of the satellite.
            He was employed in radio sales and window sales, worked for
            Morefield Communications in Altoona, PA and AT&T (Cellphone Store).
            In 2009, Steve made a video of my father&apos;s life, which was
            shown at Dad&apos;s funeral. His most recent job was with Deloitte
            Consulting. Initially he was part of the software testing team. As
            an Analyst he worked toward the overall learning development of the
            client. He then became a consultant, which required weekly travel.
            In this position he trained the client in using the software. After
            more than 7 years, Steve quit Deloitte. He built a camper in the
            back of his Subaru (carpentry skills required) and headed west for
            about 4 months; living out of his car or on the trail in the back
            country. Steve is an avid hiker starting with the Tetons, Zion
            National Park, Glacier National Park, the Adirondacks, parts of the
            Appalachian Trail, Mid-State Trail, Loyalsock Trail, etc. He has
            also hiked in New Zealand during a trip to Australia and the
            Maldives. During the summer of 2021, Steve took many photos of his
            journey requiring photography equipment and the user&apos;s talent.
            I hiked with Steve on the Black Forest Trail in 2010. I believe we
            hiked 13 miles in 10 hours. In 2017, Steve arranged a trip to the
            Shenandoah National Park in Virginia and invited Mike and I. Steve
            is now employed by Optimizely as a Customer Success Manager.

            <span class="fs-4 fw-bold">Kimberly Lynn Pritchard</span> One day in
            the summer of 1982, Cyndee invited me to lunch, which was never done
            before. Reason was to tell me she was pregnant. When Kimberly was
            born, April 12, 1983, she had dark hair all over her body (i.e. her
            forehead, back, etc.) She was slow to talk, but when she started she
            didn&apos;t stop. When little, she was enrolled in the Karen Mirecle
            Dance School. A highlight was the Daughter Daddy Dance. In school,
            she ran Cross Country & Track, played Softball, Basketball, and AYSO
            Soccer. Kim was voted to the Homecoming and Prom Courts. I
            don&apos;t remember the year, but Kim & Mike ran the Run for the
            Diamonds. The Run For The Diamonds is an annual Thanksgiving Day
            9-mile road race which takes place in Berwick. After graduating from
            IUP with a journalism degree, Kim worked for Larson O&apos;Brien
            (Intern), IMPAQT, The Star Group, Monetate Inc, Extole, Qubit, Adobe
            Commerce. At Adobe she is Head of Customer Success East. Kim was a
            Board Member for the Customer Experience Program at Seton Hall
            University. She is the mother of Mason and Myles (AKA The Bash
            Brothers).

            <span class="fs-4 fw-bold">DAN MORGAN</span>, P.O. Pott's Grove, was
            born in Aberystwyth Parish, South Wales, March 5, 1824, a son of
            William and Jane (Seer) Morgan. The former was a skilled iron worker
            in the old country, overseeing a number of hands there. About 1839
            or 1840 he came to America, and became engaged in the Mount Savage
            Iron Works, Maryland. The firm conducting these works soon failed,
            and he moved northward to Juniata, and, there engaged in a tannery.
            While there he sent for his family who came out in 1844. He remained
            at Juniata until September 1845, and then engaged in the iron works
            of the Montour Iron Company, Danville, where he remained until his
            death, which occurred March 16, 1851; his widow survived him until
            January 10, 1856. They are buried in the Methodist Cemetery,
            Danville.
          </p>
          <p>
            They were the parents of the following named children: William; Mary
            Ann was the wife of James Williams; Thomas; Dan; Jane was the wife
            of Benjamin Harris; Esther was the wife of Michael Graham, and Gad,
            all deceased except Dan. The subject of this sketch remained with
            his parents until 1845, when he left the home at Juniata, and coming
            to Danville engaged in the Montour Iron Works. In 1851 he became
            superintendent of the blast furnace for this company, and held that
            position until 1883, and part of the time he was general
            superintendent of the entire plant, except the mines. In 1867 he
            entered the company as a member, and held an interest in the works
            until 1878, when he withdrew his membership, but still retained his
            position in the works as general superintendent. He then bought 287
            acres of land in Liberty Township, this county, to which he has
            since added until he now has three farms containing 417 acres, all
            three places being supplied with the best of farm houses and
            buildings. In 1877 he came to his farm property and resided on it
            until 1879, when he went back to Danville, but after residing there
            until 1881, returned to the farm to make his permanent residence.
